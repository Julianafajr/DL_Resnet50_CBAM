[INFO] Data Augmentation has been added to the training pipeline.

[TRAINING AUGMENTATIONS]
  - RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.8, 1.0))
        → randomly crops and rescales each training image, simulating zoom/scale changes
  - RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5)
        → flips images left-right with 50% chance
  - RandomRotation(degrees=15)
        → rotates images randomly between -15° and +15°
  - ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.05)
        → randomly changes color properties of images
  - ToTensor()
        → converts image to PyTorch tensor
  - Normalize(mean=[0.485,0.456,0.406], std=[0.229,0.224,0.225])
        → normalizes pixel values for ResNet training

[VALIDATION PIPELINE]
  - Resize(256)
  - CenterCrop(224)
  - ToTensor()
  - Normalize(mean=[0.485,0.456,0.406], std=[0.229,0.224,0.225])

[HOW IT WORKS]
  • Training dataset is rebuilt per fold with `train_transforms`
  • Validation dataset uses `val_transforms` (no randomness)
  • Augmentations are applied on-the-fly inside DataLoader
  • Each epoch, the same image may appear differently 
    (cropped, flipped, rotated, or color-shifted)
  • This increases data diversity and reduces overfitting
